This folder and its content is only useful for you if you use Tiled as your level editor.
To enable Tiled support, edit the build_options.ini file in the root of this project.

The "generated" folder contains the files that are put into your ROM. The content of this folder is fully automatized,
so don't edit anything in here directly.

The "palettes" folder contain level palettes that your hack can use. Each palette file here should be 32 bytes big 
(4*4 bytes for sprites, 4*4 bytes for BG).
